# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

Is a linked list like data data structure that follows LIFO rule.  We can visualize this as vertical or horizontal, it does not matter, both are correct.  Last element added, is the first one removed.

## Queues

Is also a linked list like data structure that follows the FIFO rule.  The first element added to it, becomes the top most element in it, therefore it is the one that's removed.  The last element added is the last to be removed.
