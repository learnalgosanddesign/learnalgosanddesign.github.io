Welcome!

This website contains my own method, summary and notes for learning algorithms and system design. The main purpose is to pass FAANG interviews, as well as to use the algorithms and system design learned, to increase my own skill in order for me to become a great programmer. Its easy to become a good programmer by having a good experience on OOP, design patterns, etc. But the best programmers dive into depth, and apply the most appropriate data structure and algorithms. Even a great system design is so fundamentally simple that it does not require complex technology. To cite an example, Instagram's engineering is so fundamentally simple that by designing their own hash bucket function, they were able to scale photo storage of million users. Their language is Python, which we know is less performant than other languages.

Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

- Linus Torvalds

Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.

- Eric S. Raymond

This website contains various knowledge that comes from leetcode, binarysearch, algo.monster, cracking the coding interview, introduction to algorithms, algorithm design manual, coursera's stanford and princeton's lessons on algorithms, which I summarized in a concise way.

For me, suggested method of learning is from the foundations and building knowledge from there.

The topological sort are as follows:

1. Arrays
2. Linked lists
3. Graphs
