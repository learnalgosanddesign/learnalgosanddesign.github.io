Welcome!

This website contains summary and notes for learning algorithms and system design.

The main purpose is to learn algorithms and design, pass interviews, as well as apply algorithms and design to everyday problems to increase skill in order to become a great programmer.

Its easy to become a good programmer by having a good experience in OOP, design patterns, etc. But the best programmers dive into depth, and apply the most appropriate data structure and algorithms. Even a great system design is so fundamentally simple that it does not require complex thinking and stacks of technologies.

To cite an example, Instagram's engineering is so fundamentally simple that by designing their own hash bucket function, they were able to scale photo storage of million users. Their language is Python, which we know is less performant than other languages, but by applying the right thinking, they were still able to leverage it.

I believe in learning the foundations, basics and fundamentals first. Then diving deep into practice.
